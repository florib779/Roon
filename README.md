On this pages you'll find News, [Articles](/articles/index.md), Links and more about Roon, "the music player for music lovers", by Roon Labs. Let me call this website a kind of Roon-fanpage, but I also keep writing about other music-related topics. Let's see what happens in the future.

**I am currently porting the content of a homepage project that I am (probably) giving up due to lack of time. Much of the information is therefore still incomplete and some links may not work.**

This pages contains a lot of technical and nerdy stuff. Nevertheless, I hope that it will also be useful for the less technically interested people.

A lot of information about Roon can be found on the (new) [Roon Help Center](https://help.roonlabs.com/), but it is a good idea to look around the [Roon Community Forum](https://community.roonlabs.com/) too. In this forum you will find countless more information, as well as tips and tricks. This forum is one of the friendliest talk I've ever met.

Even though the Roon people do not respond to every topic, you can be sure that they read almost all of the posts and take inspiration for future improvements. But somethimes you have to be patient. It can sometimes take longer for a new update to come out. But every step that Roon takes seems to be very deliberate. It's done when it's done.

This forum is now so extensive that it is sometimes difficult to find the information you are looking for.

The fact that I read daily in this forum and stumble again and again on interesting information, I have decided to collect information I'm interested in and present it on this pages.

There is no deliberate use of a discussion platform on this website, because I think it is important that all information be bundled in the Roon Community Forum.
