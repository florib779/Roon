# Sources for downloadable audio files

Instead of buying downloads, it is often cheaper to buy used CDs. It makes sense to buy a download when an album is available, for example, in a higher quality. It is also advisable to compare different download provider, as they often offer the same albums in different quality and prices. Unfortunately, there are also country-specific differences.

A psychological effect of my personal experience is that you deal more intensively with a purchased album than, for example, with a streamed one.

A good source to find Hi Res Audio is [the most complete list of MQA albums so far found on Tidal](https://www.meridianunplugged.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=268318#Post268318). This is primarily about MQA files, but these are often found in FLAC or WAV format at different providers.

## Provider
It should be mentioned here only provider who offer at least CD-quality. Of course there are many other providers, but I personally use the following ones:

* [7digital](https://de.7digital.com/)
* [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)
  * An online music service and promotion platform specifically aimed at independent artists. Bandcamp artists have a modifiable microsite with the albums they upload. Many titles can be played for free on the website. Artists can specify whether music downloads are free or paid. Artists gets 80-90% of sales. Not all available HiRes-files are tagged as [HiRes](https://bandcamp.com/tag/hi-res) or [24-bit](https://bandcamp.com/tag/24-bit) by far. Sometimes the resolution is also specified in the description. I have been quite surprised sometimes that I get an album instead of CD-quality as a 24-bit version.
  For some tracks/albums lyrics are provided.
* [Burning Shed](https://burningshed.com/)
  * Label of: Porcupine Tree, Anathema, Steven Wilson...
* [HIGHRESAUDIO](https://www.highresaudio.com/)
* [Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com/)
  * All the files purchased on Qobuz are guaranteed without DRM.
