<p>Instead of buying downloads, it is often cheaper to buy used CDs. It makes sense to buy a download when an album is available, for example, in a higher quality. It is also advisable to compare different provider, as they often offer the same albums in different quality and prices. Unfortunately, there are also country-specific differences.</p>

<p>A psychological effect of my personal experience is that you deal more intensively with a purchased album than, for example, with a streamed one.</p>
<p>A good source to find Hi Res Audio is <a href="https://www.meridianunplugged.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=279136&amp;page=1">the most complete list of MQA albums so far found on Tidal</a>. This is primarily about MQA files, but these are often found in FLAC or WAV format at different providers.</p>
<h2>Provider</h2>
