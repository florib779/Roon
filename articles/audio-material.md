By default, Roon plays the highest-quality version of albums/tracks in your library, but to get Tidal albums/tracks in your library you need to favor them in Tidal or add them to Roon.

## Sampling rate

High sampling rates not only increase the maximum displayable frequency, but also make it easier to digitally edit the audio material: if the available sample rate is higher than what is needed, digital audio effects can use more samples for the calculation.

For example, if you record 16-bit in the studio, you will not get full 16-bit, but a little less. In contrast, if you record in 24 bits, you will again not get a full 24 bits, but these can be converted to 16 bit for virtually complete loss of production.

With the bit rates the quality jump from 16 to 24 bits is clear.

## Digital Watermark
Not infrequently in audiophile forums of a strange sound is reported, which can best be described as a kind of phaser effect or fluttering tremolo sound. This is mostly heard in streaming services, but also in purchased downloads and Internet radios. This is a digital watermark that is included as copy protection on Universal Music Group tracks. Universal Music recordings account for about 25% of most online catalogs, including Interscope, The Island Def Jam, Universal Republic, Verve, GRP, Impulse !, Decca, Deutsche Grammophon, Geffen, etc.

UMG uses a spread spectrum watermark. The watermarking scheme modulates the total energy in two different bands, 1 kHz to 2.3 kHz and 2.3 to 3.6 kHz. The energy is focused on the most sensitive frequencies, as it is harder to attack or remove them without significant audible distortion. The energy is increased or decreased in blocks of 0.04 seconds. Listen closely to the original and watermark audio samples and try to focus on the 1kHz to 3.6kHz noise range.
