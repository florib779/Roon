# Music Streaming

## General

If you have problems in [Roon](https://roonlabs.com/r/n6HeIaGsYUKKh60AONYs5Q) with [TIDAL](https://tidal.com/) and/or [Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com), disable your account and activate it again.

It's recommended to use [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) to improve streaming performance.

## Import playlists from TIDAL

### Import "My Mix" from TIDAL

Since Roon 1.8 (Build 806), "My Mixes" are integrated. Nevertheless, this procedure could be useful for other purposes.

In TIDAL open My Collection --> My Mix > My Mix [Number] and Create new Playlist.

After automatic or manual [playlist syncing](https://kb.roonlabs.com/Importing_playlists#TIDAL_Playlists) you will have your playlist inside Roon.
