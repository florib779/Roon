# Music Streaming

## General

If you have problems with [TIDAL](https://tidal.com/) and/or [Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com), disable your account and activate it again.

It's recommended to use [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) to improve streaming performance.

## Import playlists from TIDAL

### Import "My Mix" from TIDAL

In TIDAL open My Collection --> My Mix > My Mix [Number] and Create new Playlist.

After automatic or manual [playlist syncing](https://kb.roonlabs.com/Importing_playlists#TIDAL_Playlists) you will have your playlist inside Roon.

The same procedure works with other playlists as well.
