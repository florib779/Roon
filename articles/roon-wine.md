# Installing the Roon-Desktop-App on Linux with Wine

[Roon](https://roonlabs.com/) has no native Linux remote client yet, but I hope they will bring us one in the future. Nevertheless, there is a possibility to install it with the help of [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) under Linux.

There are some advantages to installing the Windows version over installing it on portable Android or Apple devices:

* [Export](https://help.roonlabs.com/portal/en/kb/articles/export) your music files with the Roon provided metadata (which I need for my car or smartphone)
  * It happens to me that when exporting to a directory that already contains files from a previous export, the temp folder of Wine runs full. If your hard drive is not big enough, the worst-case scenario is that the system freezes or Roon crashes.
* Export your music library to an excel file
* Adding convolution files
* Editing with keyboard and mouse (no tipping on touchscreen), which I think itâ€™s more comfortable
* Bigger Screen
* Roon UI runs smoother in most ways
* Of course it's possible to use [Windows Keyboard Shortcuts](https://help.roonlabs.com/portal/en/kb/articles/keyboard-shortcuts#Windows_Keyboard_Shortcuts)

After the installation you should have a working Roon remote, server and endpoint. The main interest would be the remote (I think most Roon users will run a separate Roon core). Server and endpoint of the full version are not tested yet, but should also work.

See also Roon for TV. In this project I installed the Roon desktop app using Wine and also the native Linux version of the roon server.
