On this pages you'll find [Articles](/Roon/articles/) about Roon, "the music player for music lovers", by [Roon Labs](https://roonlabs.com).

This pages contains a lot of technical and nerdy stuff. Nevertheless, I hope that it will also be useful for the less technically interested people.

A lot of information about Roon can be found on the [Roon Help Center](https://help.roonlabs.com/), but it is a good idea to look around the [Roon Community Forum](https://community.roonlabs.com/) too. In this forum you will find countless more information, as well as tips and tricks.

Even though the Roon people do not respond to every topic, you can be sure that they read almost all of the posts and take inspiration for future improvements. But somethimes you have to be patient. It can sometimes take longer for a new update to come out. But every step that Roon takes seems to be very deliberate. It's done when it's done.

This forum is now so extensive that it is sometimes difficult to find the information you are looking for.

The fact that I read daily in this forum and stumble again and again on interesting information, I have decided to collect information I'm interested in and present it on this pages.
